<p>A tale as old as time. Boy goes skiing. Girl runs hotel. Boy swipes right. Girl swipes right back.</p>
<p>Drinks at a biker bar, stargazing, two more dates before girl admits she kinda likes boy. Girl moves to Texas, boy moves to Cincinnati. Occasional visits and vacations together. Boy moves to Washington D.C. and finally wisens up and realizes girl has to join him. Surprise trip to Montana for a proposal, 115 venues considered and now they're getting married!</p>

        <h2 class="w3-center">Where should I stay?</h2>
        <p class="left-text">Please refer to our <a href="{{ url_for('travel') }}">lodging section</a>. For folks who do not want to stay within Olympic Valley, Tahoe City & Truckee have many lodging options. Note: transportation will not be provided from these locations and you will need to drive to the venue.</p></br>
        <h2 class="w3-center">How should I get to the venue?</h2>
        <p class="left-text">If you are staying in Olympic Valley we will be providing shuttle transportation. Prior to the wedding, we will send out a form where folks can let us know where they are staying and we will arrange pick-up locations. If you are not staying in Olympic Valley you will need to drive to The Resort at Squaw Creek. Note: Uber/Lyfts are not reliable in the North Lake Tahoe area and we do not advise relying on them as your mode of transportation over the weekend.</p></br>
        <h2 class="w3-center">What is cocktail attire?</h2>

        <h2 class="w3-center">Any COVID considerations to be aware of?</h2>
        <p class="left-text"></p>Our wedding events are primarily outdoors. Please use your best judgment if you are feeling sick and take a covid test if you have symptoms, that way we can all comfortably party together on the dance floor. </br>

        <h2 class="w3-center">How should I get to the venue?</h2>
        <p class="standard-text-wide">If you are staying in downtown Austin, we will be providing shuttle transportation from the Downright Austin Hotel. If you are not staying downtown we recommend taking an Uber/Lyfts to the venue as they do not allow for overnight parking.</p></br>

        <h2 class="w3-center">Will it be hot?</h2>
        <p class="standard-text-wide">It's best to assume it will still be 85Â°F after sunset. Love and commitment are excellent ways to beat the heat, but a few other helpful products follow as well: <a href="https://www.hammacher.com/product/quiet-wearable-portable-fan-0#">Neck Fans</a> <a href="https://www.bandelettes.com/">Bandlettes</a>

        <h2 class="w3-center">Are kids welcome?</h2>
        <p class="standard-text-wide">Only children who specifically recieved an invitation can join for the ceremony/reception, but all children are welcome to the surrounding activities! We will do our best to help coordinate babysitters if you are traveling to Austin with your little ones.</p></br>

        <h2 class="w3-center">Should I rent a car while I'm in Austin??</h2>
        <p class="standard-text-wide">Renting a car could be useful if you do not plan to stay in central Austin. In the downtown/east side area where we will be spending most of our time, parking can be tricky (no towing, just very limited options) and its pretty affordable to rideshare or scooter. Its also safe to walk in all neighborhoods in Austin. A Lyft from the airport to the suggested hotels should run $28-45 depending on what time you arrive in town.</p></br>

        <h2 class="w3-center">Are there any COVID considerations to be aware of?</h2>
        <p class="standard-text-wide">Our wedding events are primarily outdoors. Please use your best judgment if you are feeling sick and take a covid test if you have symptoms, that way we can all comfortably party together on the dance floor. If you need a COVID test, we will have some on-site. Please reach out to Michael or Ashleigh if needed. Masking at the wedding itself is totally acceptable if you are testing negative for Covid but what to still prevent others from coming down with a cold, etc. </p></br>

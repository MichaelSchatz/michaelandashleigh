        <p>We recommend that guests stay in Olympic Valley. On the east side, is the Olympic Village where you'll find most of the bars, shops, restaurants, and several lodging options. A <5 minute shuttle or 20 minute walk from the village will take you to the Resort at Squaw Creek which is where the wedding reception and brunch will be held. There is a public shuttle that runs daily until 10pm between the Olympic Village and the Resort at Squaw Creek. We will also be providing additional transportation for extended hours within Olympic Valley the day of the wedding.</p>
        <p>We have a <a href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/group-booking/RNODH/G-R0MZ">room block</a> at the wedding venue, The Resort at Squaw Creek (rooms starting at $395/night)</p>  
        <p>There are some great Airbnbs in Olympic Valley if you are coming with a larger group. If you are wondering if our transportation will pick up at your Airbnb, please contact Guy or Leah to confirm. Below are some hotels within Olympic Valley with a range of options. Prices at these are subject to change, so we recommend booking early. </p></br>
